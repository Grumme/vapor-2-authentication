This repo contains a demo project. which includes authentication, auth routes and roles.

This is the starting point for my Server Side Swift backend built with Vapor 2.

## How to get started

* `cd to/your/path`
* run `vapor xcode -y` for generating the project
* Update database information in `mysql.json` (In Config folder)
* Hit ´run´
